## Working with diferent different NLP pipelines Using Hugging Face Pre-trained transformers with different pretrained LLM models

Description

This project leverages the power of Hugging Face Transformers to provide a suite of Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines for various tasks:

  1) Text Classification: Categorize text into predefined classes (e.g., sentiment analysis, topic classification).
  
  2) Text Summarization: Create concise summaries of longer pieces of text.
  
  3) Text Generation: Generate new text based on a given prompt or style.
  
  4) Text Translation: Translate text from one language to another.
  
  5) Question Answering: Extract answers to questions posed about a given passage.
  
Requirements:

  Python 3.x (Recommended: 3.6 or later)
  
  Hugging Face Transformers library (pip install transformers)
  
  Additional dependencies may be required based on specific pipelines (see "Pipeline-Specific Requirements").

Pipeline-Specific Instructions

1) Text Classification :

  Customize the pre-trained model and hyperparameters.

2) Text Summarization :
  
  Adjust the max_length parameter to control the summary length.
  
3) Text Generation :

  Provide a prompt or starting text as input.
  
  Experiment with different temperature values for more or less creative generation.
  
4) Text Translation :

  Specify the source and target languages.
  
  Explore different translation models available in Hugging Face Transformers.
  
5) Question Answering :

  Provide a passage and a question as input.
  
  Consider fine-tuning a question answering model on your specific domain data.
